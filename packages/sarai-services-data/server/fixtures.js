By analyzing the images captured by the multispectral camera, scientists can tell if the plants are healthy, stressed, lacking water or nutrients without destroying them or pulling them out from the field for analysis in a laboratory. Using the results from the image analysis, the scientists can advise farmers how to manage their crops to increase yield.</p><p>Uses of Multispectral Images</p><p>The multispectral camera captures images of various colors using a special lens, filters and sensors. The brightness of the image for a given color can be used as an indication of the health of the plants. By analyzing these colors, the amount of chlorophyll, water content and other nutrients present in the plants can be determined.</p><p>The images taken by the multispectral camera are 2 infrareds (900nm and 800 nm), red-edge (720 nm), red (680 nm), green (550 nm) and blue (490 nm). By taking the ratios of the intensities of colors, vegetation indices (such as normalized differential vegetation index or NDVI) can be computed. These indices provide indication of the health of the plants.</p>'

Such materials are important components of mass communication or public information campaigns. It is the process of learning that empowers people to make informed decisions, modify behaviors and change social conditions. In order to design these IEC materials, the team had to conduct training needs analyses (TNA) to ensure that the developed resources suit their target audiences. According to the TNA results, in most farming communities, access to information is very variable. Such differences are anchored on the differences in the farmers’ economic circumstances and their ability to adopt technological developments (reflected as a function of age range, educational attainment, and the likes). Additionally, a national lack of reliable extension-communication infrastructure, particularly of internet and mobile connectivity, is blocking significant progress in this field. Hence, the TNA showed a huge demand for on-site, face to face trainings over an online-based approach. Despite these observations, Project SARAI is preparing to utilize both approaches to ensure the sustainability of its efforts and investments.</p><p>To spread scientific agricultural knowledge and to present the new technologies on Smarter Farming, SARAI Eskwela was created for the farmers as an avenue to access information and interaction with SARAI experts. SARAI Eskwela will serve through both online and field-based platforms where all the developed resources will be utilized.  The online platform will be hosting the IEC materials, training modules, and other such materials, including testimonials intended for audiences with access to the internet. Field and classroom-based SARAI Eskwela is also being developed to answer the demand for face to face trainings.</p>'
