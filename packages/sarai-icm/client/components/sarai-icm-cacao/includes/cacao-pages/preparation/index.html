			<p><strong>AGRO-CLIMATIC REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>
			<p>Cacao can grow within a wide range of soil conditions, but the ideal soil must
			be well drained, aerated, and must have good moisture retention. Although,
			providing a good drainage system can be established in waterlogged areas.
			The most ideal soil is made up of aggregated clay or loamy sand (50% sand,
			30-40% clay, and 10-20% silt).</p>

			<p>In areas with long dry season, deep soil (150 cm or more) highly favors the
			growth of cacao. While in areas with even rainfall distribution, cacao can be
			grown even with a soil depth of 60-70 cm. However, cacao can tolerate soil
			pH which ranges from 5.5 to 8.0 but the best pH is 6.5.</p>

			<p>Rainfall and temperature are the most crucial climatic factors which
			determine the suitability of an area for cacao production. The rainfall most
			ideal for cacao cultivation ranges from 1250-3000 mm per annum, ideally
			1500-2000 mm with dry season of not more than three months or else,
			irrigation should be put up.</p>

			<p>Ideal temperature for cacao cultivation ranges from mean minimum of 18°C
			to mean maximum of 32°C. Altitude also determines the suitability of an area
			for cacao production because temperature is associated with elevation. The
			most suitable temperature for cacao cultivation is at altitude up to 700 m.
			Highest yielding cacao farms in Davao are located about 200-300 m above
			sea level and in the highlands (500-820 masl).</p>
			
			<p>In the Philippines, provinces with evenly distributed rainfall throughout the
			year (Type IV climate) are the most suitable for cacao cultivation. These
			include most of central, eastern and southern Mindanao, Bohol, northeastern
			Luzon, southwest Camarines Norte, west of Camarines Sur and Albay. Cacao
			is very sensitive to strong winds and planting should be avoided in areas
			frequented by typhoons. This may cause defoliation or premature leaf fall due
			to water loss or mechanical injury.</p>

			<p>Based on elevation, slope, temperature, climate type and soil type, Figure 3
			illustrates the suitability map of cacao in the Philippines.</p>
