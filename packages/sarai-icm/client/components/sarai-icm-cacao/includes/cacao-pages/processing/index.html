			<h1>Cacao - Processing</h1>
			<!---->
			<p><strong>PRIMARY PROCESSING</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
			<p>POD SPLITTING AND SEED EXTRACTION</p>
			<p>In opening the pods, wooden baton or devised pod splitter are used to avoid damaging the seeds. Sharp knife is not recommended since it can cut the seeds, resulting in low quality beans. Damaged seeds attract molds and insects, while broken beans are rejected during sorting and grading.</p>
			<p>Once the pods are opened, the beans are removed with the fingers or a scoop, making sure to separate the placenta from the wet beans in the process. After seed extraction, pod husks must be spread in the field. This practice will recycle the nutrient particularly the potassium to the soil and will prevent canker infestation.</p>
			<p>FERMENTATION</p>
			<p>Fermentation is done to produce good quality beans in terms of color and aroma. There are factors that influence fermentation, and these include type of cacao, ripeness of the pods, quantity of beans, and duration of fermentation. Cacao must undergo 5 days fermentation, with first turn done after 48 hours, and the second turn after another 48 hours, which will result in lower acidity. Fermentation progress is evaluated by means of odor, and external and internal color of the beans.</p>
			<p>There are three methods of fermentation:</p>
			<ol>
			<li>Fermentation in boxes. The standard depth of fermentation boxes is 45 cm to ensure better quality, flavor and lower acidity. Fermentation box of 85 cm x 85 cm x 45 cm deep can accommodate about 300 kg of wet beans while 75 cm x 75 cm x 45 cm deep and 1.0 m x 1.0 m x 45 cm deep can accommodate about 200 kg and 400 kg of wet beans, respectively. The boxes are arranged in rows or in cascades to facilitate easy mixing and transfers of beans. The best fermentation boxes have slatted flooring with gaps of 3 mm to 5mm, and should be elevated from the ground. It is best to maintain the fermenting cacao just 40 cm deep and covered with jute sacks during the fermentation period to conserve the heat of reaction.</li>
			</ol>
			<ol start="2">
			<li>Fermentation in heaps. Wet beans are placed on banana leaves or bamboo mats given with sufficient perforations. Leaves or mats are raised from the ground, supported on platforms, to allow drainage and aeration. The heap is covered with the same material or perforated sacks to conserve heat, to prevent rainwater from entering the mass of seeds, and to avoid contamination or mold formation. Turning of beans may be done every other day.</li>
			</ol>
			<ol start="3">
			<li>Basket fermentation. Wet beans are fermented in basket lined with banana leaves or perforated sacks to provide drainage. The baskets are raised from the ground. Wet beans of 50 kg or more completely ferment in 5-6 days with mixing or turning after 48 hours from loading the wet beans. The basket containing wet beans must be placed under roof to prevent rainwater from entering the mass of seeds. Jute bags are used to cover the baskets to avoid losses of heat which is critical for good fermentation.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>DRYING</p>
			<p>After fermentation, beans are dried to reduce moisture content from 45% to 7% to maintain bean quality during storage. The drying process also facilitates the removal of excessive acidity through evaporation of acetic acid through the outer skin while it is still moist.</p>
			<p>There are two processes of drying:</p>
			<ol>
			<li>Sun drying. Beans are spread out in platforms to dry in the radiant heat of the sun. The total drying time at full day sunshine is 31 hours or 5-8 days at 4-6 hours sunshine each day. In the Philippines, the most practical approach is the combined sun-mechanical drying: starts with sun drying for 1-2 days and finishes up with artificial drying.</li>
			</ol>
			<ol start="2">
			<li>Artificial drying. This process involves usage of artificial dryers. The temperature must not exceed 60°C to remove the water from the beans gradually. Rapid drying favors the beans to retain excessive amounts of acetic acid which results to ‘acidic’ beans while if drying is too slow, off-flavors may arise and molds will develop. To ensure uniformly dried beans, frequent and thorough mixing of the beans in the artificial dryer is very important. Normally, dryers are designed with heat energy sources from burning solid fuel, like wood, coconut shell, but must have indirect heating function. A heat exchanger system is employed to avoid smoke contamination of the seeds that would significantly affect the quality of the beans.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>STORAGE OF DRIED CACAO BEANS</p>
			<p>For safe storage, the moisture content of cacao beans should lie between 6 to 7%. Molds may develop in the beans above 8% moisture level, while beans may become too brittle below 5%. Properly dried cacao beans, when cooled, must break into two parts when snapped between the fingers, rather than bend or shatter. Beans are cooled before these are bagged in jute or plastic sacks.</p>
			<p>To ensure safe storage facility, the building should have a cemented floor and walls. It should be well-ventilated. This will minimize the problems of mold development and the spread of other pests. Sacks may be placed directly on the floor provided it is not moist. Or they could be stacked on pallets which lift the sacks 5-10 cm from the floor. Properly dried cacao beans can be stored for two or three months. For prolonged storage, extra precautions must be observed to ensure that quality beans will not deteriorate due to molds and pests incidence.</p>
			<p>CACAO BEAN QUALITY</p>
			<p>Cacao beans must be selected from ripe pods, adequately fermented and dried, free from smoky smell and other undesirable odor. Beans selected must be uniform in size and free from any evidence of adulteration. Broken beans, beans with fragments and pieces of shell must be discarded. They must be free from foreign matter and from insect pests. The moisture content of cacao beans in trade outside the producing country as defined at the first port of destination or subsequent points must not exceed 7.5%. The consignment of bean must contain no more than 2.5% waste by weight.</p>

			<p>Cacao beans are graded according to Philippine National Standard for Cacao Beans:<img src="/packages/sarai_sarai-icm/public/images/cacao/processing/table-2-1.png" alt="table 2" width="500" height="300"></p>

			<p>Cacao beans that exceed one of the limits accepted for Grade 2 must be regarded as sub-standard and marked “SS”. Sub-standard cacao must only be marketed under special contract.</p>
