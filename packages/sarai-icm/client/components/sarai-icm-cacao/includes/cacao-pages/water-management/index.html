			<h1>Cacao - Water Management</h1>

			<p><strong>WATER MANAGEMENT</strong></p>
			<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The advantage of irrigating cacao farm involves the insurance against damage during unexpected long drought. It also increases yield. Some large farms combined irrigation and fertilizer application known as fertigation that promotes efficient use of labor.</p>
			<p>The following are the different methods used by private plantation in irrigating cacao:</p>
			<p>Overhead sprinkler – useful during the juvenile stage of cacao plants. When the plants are fully matured, this method requires a high operation pressure to produce fine mist to avoid flower disturbance. This method is very laborious particularly when the pipes are portable. It also requires very high energy to operate. The water use efficiency is ranging from 30 to 50%.</p>

When the plants are fully matured, this method requires a high operation pressure to produce fine mist to avoid flower disturbance. This method is very laborious particularly when the pipes are portable. It also requires very high energy to operate. The water use efficiency is ranging from 30 to 50%.</p>
			<p>b. Drip irrigation – the manpower requirement is minimal once the gadgets are installed. The energy usage is very small since it can be operated in a very low pressure. Also, fertilization can be incorporated into the system thereby reducing the cost of fertilizer application. The disadvantage of this method is the high initial cost.</p>
			<p>c. Surface or flood irrigation – this method is used when the terrain of the plantation is flat and when there is abundant supply of gravity water. It requires a very high volume of water and efficiency is very low.</p>
			<p>Regardless of the method of irrigation used, the water requirement of cacao does not vary. The consumptive use of cacao lies between 4 to 6 mm/day or 40 to 60 m<sup>3 </sup>of water per ha per day. This can be supplied by 150 mm of rain per month assuming that it is evenly distributed. Therefore, irrigation water may be needed only during drier months and when the required volume of water is not available.</p>
