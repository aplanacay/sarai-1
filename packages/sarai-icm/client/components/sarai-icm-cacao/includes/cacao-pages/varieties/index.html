			<h1>Cacao - Varieties</h1>
			<!---->
			<p> Three varieties of cacao:</p>

			<p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						 Criollo - it is of superior quality with pods commonly elongated and strongly ridged. The pods are red or yellow with comparatively thin skin and plump pale-colored seeds. It is susceptible to pests. 
					</li>
					<li>
						 Forastero - it is hardier, vigorous and high yielding compared to Criollo. The pods are round, thick-walled which become yellow when ripe and has flat, violet seeds. Amelonado (one group of Forastero) is more genetically uniform. 
					</li>
					<li>
						 Trinitario - it is possibly a hybrid between Criollo and Amelonado. It shows the characteristics of the hybrid population and could be the richest source of materials for the development of cacao by breeding.
					</li>

				RECOMMENDED CLONES/HYBRIDS/SELECTIONS
			</h3>

			<p>
				It is recommended to plant 3 to 5 varieties/clones of cacao in a farm to enhance pollination. The recommended clones/varieties to be used in are ideally the following approved clones by the National Seed Industry Council (NSIC):
			</p>
			<p>
				BR 25
