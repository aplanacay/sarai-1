			<h1>Cacao - Management Practices</h1>
			<!---->
			<p><strong>FIELD PLANTING</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
			<p>SOIL ANALYSIS</p>
			<p>The first step to consider in field planting of cacao is the conduct of soil analyses for its physical and chemical properties. Soil texture and structure are evaluated. Also, the soil strata is evaluated specifically the depth of the surface soil and whether or not hard pan is present. The drainage network and design would depend on the result of the physical analysis.</p>
			<p>The result of the chemical soil analysis defines the need for amelioration like liming for acidic soil; usually red colored soils that are mostly found in upland areas are acidic. This also helps in determining the amount of organic or inorganic nutrients to be added to the soil before transplanting.</p>
			<p>CLEARING THE AREA</p>
			<p>The system used in clearing the area depends on the existing vegetation, whether it is a previously cropped area, cogonal field, second growth and virgin forest. In previously cropped areas, manual, mechanical or chemical weeding can be done in controlling weeds like cogon and talahib.</p>
			<p>ESTABLISHMENT OF ROADS AND DRAINAGE NETWORK</p>
			<p>In large cacao farms, roads should be accessible to facilitate farm operations. Typically, roads comprise about 6 to 8% of the farm. It is advisable in large farms, that main roads should be spaced 400 to 600 m apart and 200 m apart for the laterals. Roads must be laid out across the slope or along contours. If needed, narrow roads should be provided with side drain as interceptor for excess rain water.</p>
			<p>Drainage is vital in the farm as conveyance for excess water that could uproot cacao trees and wash away topsoil. In sloping and hilly areas, drainage canals may not seem necessary. The spacing distance and dimension of drainage canals and slope gradient depends on the topography of the farm.</p>
			<p>ESTABLISHMENT OF SHADE AND CANOPY MANAGEMENT</p>
			<p>Shade is very important for young cacao plants/seedlings. Cacao cannot tolerate high light intensity because it will result to the scalding of leaves. In open areas, shade plants should be established at least 6 months prior to field planting of cacao. Shade trees should be planted parallel to the planting lines. The recommended shade trees are ipil-ipil, madre de cacao, pigeon pea or banana. If the area to be planted is a second or virgin forest, it is better to keep some trees to serve as shade. In exposed areas, coconut fronds may be used as shade to prevent direct exposure of cacao plants to sunlight.</p>
			<p>Shade requirement for cacao varies according to the growth stages of cacao. Small plant needs more shade of 70-80% in the first of the early 2 months. As the plant grow, shade is gradually removed. Light intensity should be maintained at 50-75%, thus, temporary shade should be placed whenever light intensity exceeds. Coconut fronds are recommended as the shade material since these are usually available and have the advantage of allowing the shade to be adjusted easily. Remove the shade gradually in a period of one year after field planting to prevent scorching the foliage of cacao.</p>
			<p>Procedure in construction of shade:</p>
			<ol>
			<li>Lay-out the area and put stakes on the points where posts would be installed.</li>
			<li>Dig a hole at least 60 cm deep and firmly install the posts.</li>
			<li>Install a bamboo or ipil-ipil for lintels about 2 m high.</li>
			<li>Place coconut fronds over the lintels and arrange them where partial shading is attained.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>LIMING</p>
			<p>Growth of cacao at any growth stage is always poor when planted in acidic soils. To correct the pH of an acidic soil, application of lime is necessary. Cacao grows best in a pH ranging from 5.0 to 6.5. Lime is usually applied to acidic soil by broadcasting about 3 months before planting. The effect of lime will usually last for two years from the time of application. Hence, it is necessary to apply lime every two years.</p>
			<p>STAKING AND SPACING</p>
			<p>The planting points are to be marked with stakes using cable wire or the like as guide for straight line planting. Spacing or planting distance greatly depends on density, cropping system, varieties and shade condition.</p>
			<p>HOLE DIGGING</p>
			<p>The size of the hole should be big enough to accommodate the ball of the soil holding the seedling. Usually, a hole 30 cm wide by 30 cm long by 30 cm deep is enough. In holing, separate the topsoil (6” deep, more fertile than subsoil) from the subsoil. The topsoil will be used to cover the base of the ball of soil holding the seedling. Remove the polybag when planting the seedling into the hole. Plant the seedlings immediately after digging holes to preserve the available moisture in the soil. Put back the topsoil and press the soil firmly into the space between the seedling and the sides of the hole.</p>
			<p>PLANTING</p>
			<p>Generally, an initial population of 1,000 to 1,500 trees per hectare is recommended. To ensure uniformity in cacao production, plant only asexually propagated planting materials of known yield capability and resistance and/or tolerance to common pests and diseases. Through vegetative propagation, it gives more advantages in terms of reproduction of true to type trees, more uniform growth, early to bear flowers, and the clone perpetuates most if not all significant characteristics of the original seedling mother tree such as pod value, bean size, fruit wall thickness and others. It is advisable to use at least 5 clones in vegetative propagation to minimize the bad effect of self-incompatibility and risk in pest development with a single clone.</p>
			<p>Using clonally propagated seedlings for field planting gives uniform and high quality seedlings and the labor requirement for maintenance is minimal. However, these clonal seedlings are subjected to transplanting shocks. Use clonal seedlings which have six pairs of leaves and which are hardened or have no new flush of leaves. It is not advisable to utilize seedlings with young and soft flush leaves as they are susceptible to sunburn, planting shocks or stress. The best time to plant is during the early morning or at late afternoon when the weather is not too hot. If irrigation water is a problem then planting of the seedlings should be scheduled when rain is most likely to fall.</p>

			<p><strong>PRUNING</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
			<p>Pruning is done a) to control the shape and height of the tree; b) to remove diseased and damaged parts; c) to facilitate easy access to the plant for spraying, harvesting and other operations; d) to help reduce pest and disease infestation; and e) to increase cacao pod production.</p>
			<p>Pruning is best practice during dry months or after harvest. To make a clear smooth cut, use a pruning saw/shear. After cutting, the exposed surface is painted with coal and lead paint. After sometime new growth appears at the cut surface. It is recommended to cut them immediately unless they are used to replace a dead or unhealthy branch.</p>
			<p>Pruning of young trees (less than 3 years) is limited to removal of weak fan branches, leaving only 3 to 4 equally spaced fan branches, a few months after jorquette formation. Chupons, or side shoots, growing at the base of the stem should be removed regularly. For the older trees (more than 4 years) that have never been pruned before, the farmer must know how to determine the branches to be pruned and the appropriate method to be performed.</p>
			<p>Opening the canopy of the cacao tree is done for the following purposes:</p>
			<ol>
			<li>To provide openings for sunshine to penetrate that will lessen the amount of pests that like dark places.</li>
			<li>More sunshine on the stem will also induce more flowering, which will result to production of larger amount of cacao pods.</li>
			<li>To reduce the humidity level. This is important to lessen certain diseases like fungi.</li>
			<li>To make the trees more healthy and productive.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>There are three types of pruning:</p>
			<ol>
			<li>Formative Pruning</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The shape of a cacao is formed and maintained in an inverted umbrella-shaped structure in order to allow the penetration of good sunlight and induce flowering and pod set.</p>
			<p>The two major aspects of formative pruning are: the adjustment of the height of the first jorquette; and the control of vertical growth. Normally, pruning of newly planted cacao tree is done after the first jorquette formation. Old cacao trees may undergo heavy pruning because the desired shape and form have to be established and keep the tree in good productive form.</p>
			<ol start="2">
			<li>Maintenance Pruning</li>
			</ol>
			<p>This is done at least once every two months and normally involves the removal of water sprouts. The shape and form of cacao trees has to be maintained at the following feature:</p>
			<p>– the center of the tree is open for good sunlight penetration</p>
			<p>– there is sufficient air space for leaves and branches</p>
			<p>– overlapping branches and sprouts growing below jorquette level are removed.</p>
			<ol start="3">
			<li>Pest and Disease Pruning</li>
			</ol>
			<p>This is the immediate removal of diseased or infested parts and is done without regard to its effect on tree form.</p>
			<p><strong>REHABILITATION OF TREES</strong></p>
			<p>Rehabilitation of cacao trees is done primarily to improve yield and/or the quality of beans. It is usually done under the following conditions:</p>
			<ol>
			<li>When the plantation contains many unproductive trees known as free boarders. Free boarders are trees that develop only a few pods in spite of profuse flowering or trees that produce limited flowers and pods,</li>
			<li>When trees become old and less productive, and</li>
			<li>When the varieties/clones planted are generally low yielding and/or produce poor quality beans.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Rehabilitation can be carried out by: removing or replacing the existing unproductive trees through side grafting or bark-grafting. This involves the use of scions from plants known for high yield and quality beans, to be grafted to existing unproductive trees in the plantation.</p>
			<p>SIDE GRAFTING</p>
			<p>Low yielding or non-productive trees can be rejuvenated to produce more pods by grafting branches from selected high yielding trees unto the unproductive trees. Trees subjected for rehabilitation are either young trees that have never produced a satisfactory number of pods, or very old trees that no longer produce as many pods as they used to. The scions or budwoods for grafting are collected from desirable trees selected for both high productivity and resistance/tolerance to major pests and diseases.</p>
			<p>The use of side grafting as a means of rehabilitating trees requires the mastery of certain steps, skills and techniques in plant propagation. These includes the following: a) suitable selection and collection of scions or budsticks, b) proper preparation of the trees for grafting, c) putting the grafts in the appropriate place, d) taking care of the new grafts until they have grown firmly into the trees, and e) maintenance of the grafted branches.</p>
			<p>A single tree can have up to three side grafts, but each grafting procedure should be performed at least one month apart.</p>
