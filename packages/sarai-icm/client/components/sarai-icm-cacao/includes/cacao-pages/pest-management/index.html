			<h1>Cacao - Pest Diseases and Management</h1>
			<!---->
			<p><strong>PEST MANAGEMENT</strong></p>
			<p>CACAO POD BORER</p>
			<p>It is caused by <em>Conopomorpha cramerella </em>and the most serious pest of cacao in the Philippines. Orange-brown eggs are laid individually on the furrows of pods and the eggs are hatched in 3 to 4 days. The larvae bore through the husk and feed on the pulp inside the pod which results to malformed beans of inferior quality. Pods in the canopy are more infested compared to those in the trunk. In 15 to 18 days, the larvae become full-grown. In the pod, the larvae are off white and become pale green as they feed through the green husk. Generally, damage is barely noticeable from the outside of the pod while severely infested pods may have yellow prematurely ‘ripe’ patches. The larva pupates in small, flat, membranous cocoons normally on the dried leaves on the ground. The pupal period is 7 to 10 days.</p>
			<p><u>Control measures</u></p>
			<p>All ripe pods must be harvested weekly in order to break the life cycle of the pest. All empty cacao pod husks must be buried. All other diseased pods, black pods and pods eaten by animals from the tree must be removed. Cacao trees must be pruned to increase the sunlight which the pest does not prefer. Young pods must be bagged or sleeved with newspapers or plastic bags. Cacao trees must be fertilized to increase the overall health of the tree and also to increase cacao production. <em>Trichogrammatoidea </em>sp. can be used as biological control by releasing at the rate of 30 million individuals in one year.</p>
			<p>MIRIDS OR CAPSID BUGS</p>
			<p>It is caused by <em>Helopeltis bakeri </em>Pappius and <em>H. collaris </em>Stal. The insect sucks the juice of the pod by inserting stylet-like mouth parts into the plant resulting in the formation of a small water-soaked area of tissue that quickly becomes black. On infested pods, black lesions appear circular while on stems, they are oval and bigger. Lesions can also serve as entry points of damaging fungi. Cultural conditions in the plantation influences the pattern of attack. If overhead shade is not present, the damage is spread out and the general scorched appearance resulting from the many damaged shoots is called as “capsid blast”. If overhead shade is present, the damage is observed locally below the gaps in the shade cover. Therefore, trees under the gaps may be completely damaged while nearby trees in the shade may be less damaged.</p>
			<p><u>Control measures</u></p>
			<p>Seedlings of a vigorous variety must be planted. Gaps in the canopy of cacao must be covered using banana that should be removed as the canopy closes. Gaps in the overhead shade must also be covered. Badly affected areas must be weeded. Regular harvesting must be done.</p>
			<p>MEALYBUG</p>
			<p>It is caused by <em>Planococcus lilacinus </em>Cockerell. Adults are globular-shaped and white that feed on leaves, young shoots, flower cushions and developing pods. Feeding results to distorted shoots, stunted growth, and wilted cherelles.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
			<p><strong>DISEASE MANAGEMENT</strong></p>
			<p>CACAO POD ROT</p>
			<p>It is caused by <em>Phytophthora palmivora. </em>At early stages of infection, small brown spots become visible on the pod. The spot expands quickly and covers the whole pod in 1 to 2 weeks. The beans from immature pods are completely destroyed. On infected mature pods, the beans may still be revived since there is already a space between the beans and the husk.</p>
			<p><u>Control measures</u></p>
			<p>Non-productive branches and shade trees must be pruned regularly. Weeding must also be done regularly. All the infested, dead, and mummified pods on the trees must be removed and buried. Drainage canals must be maintained to lessen disease incidence. Frequent harvesting must be practiced. Insects and rodents must be controlled to reduce inoculum for infection. Lime must be applied to increase soil pH and to suppress Phytophthora.</p>
			<p>VASCULAR STREAK DIEBACK (VSD)</p>
			<p>It is caused by <em>Oncobasidium theobromae</em> which is a xylem-inhabiting, obligate fungus. It is a common disease which affects both adult cacao trees and seedlings. It is a systemic plant infection occurring first on the young leaves onto the vascular tissues of the stem. Spores of the fungus are wind-borne and are produced at night after a rainfall. From initial infection, the symptoms become visible after 3 to 5 months.</p>
			<p>On infected seedlings, leaves of shoots dry up. In mature trees, leaf of the second and third flush at the back of the branch tip becomes yellow, and distinctive round green spots become visible. An infected branch still has the youngest and oldest leaves but no middle leaves. Axillary buds sprout but have marginal interveinal necrosis. White crust becomes visible on the scar of fallen leaves during wet season. When affected branches are split longitudinally, brown streaks of wood tissues become visible inside the branch. Infected mature trees may survive but its yield is heavily affected while infected seedlings often die.</p>
			<p><u>Control measures</u></p>
			<p>VSD tolerant varieties must be planted. Nursery shed must be secured with plastic roofs to protect the leaves from getting wet at night. Infected portions must be pruned. The infected branches are cut 6-12 inches from the last brown streaking and the cut portion is painted with coal tar to prevent re-entry of fungus. Humidity on the shade of the cacao trees must be reduced.</p>
			<p>STEM CANKER</p>
			<p>It is caused by <em>Phytophthora </em>sp. Phytophthora scatters from infected pods to the peduncle of new pods and into the flower cushion. It remains in the cushion or it may scatter further into the stem. It was found out that cankers are significantly associated with attack by the weevil <em>Pantorhytes plutus </em>and the Scolytid beetle. Contaminated pruning knives and other equipment can also transmit infection.</p>
			<p>It is difficult to detect early infection because infected bark does not show external symptoms but a pink discoloration of the cambial tissues can be seen already. After exposure, the pink color darkens. Two fungi, <em>Calonectria </em>and <em>Fusarium </em>spp., normally coexist with the pathogen. In resistant cacao varieties, host scar tissues initiate around the lesion and subordinate fungi take over. The affected tissue becomes brown and is invaded by insects that remove the diseased tissue to remain a clean scar. While in susceptible varieties, the active phase of Phytophthora is more prolonged and the subordinate fungi do not take over. The canker stays for several months, sometimes years. It serves as inoculum for infection of other plant organs. A bright red exudate can be seen from the canker.</p>
			<p><u>Control measures</u></p>
			<p>Resistant varieties must be planted. Very susceptible trees must be removed.</p>
			<p>Outer bark must be scraped off and canker must be painted with fungicide (ex. Metalaxyl). Big affected trees must be cut down and burnt. Infected branches must be pruned carefully. Shade must be reduced.</p>
