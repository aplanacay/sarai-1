			<p><strong>CACAO INDUSTRY PROFILE</strong></p>
			<p>Cacao (<em>Theobroma cacao </em>L.) is one of the most valuable commodities in the world market and its industry is composed largely of small-holder farmers in the Philippines. Cacao beans are processed to make cocoa mass, cocoa powder and chocolates.</p>
			<p>A Spanish mariner introduced cacao in the Philippines sometime in 1670. The crop thrived into an industry with a 9% average growth rate in production for the last 10 years (1977-1986) because of the continued increase in area planted from 4,400 ha in 1977 to 15,230 ha in 1986. The local production of cacao beans has constantly increased during the past 10 years, 1977-1986. Production from 1977 was estimated at 2,900 t and gradually increased to 6,240 t in 1986.</p>
			<p>In spite of this increment in production, the demand by local processors for quality beans would not still be sufficed. This shortage was supplied through importation of cacao beans and cacao products from foreign countries like Ghana, Brazil, Ivory Coast and Dominican Republic. The highest volume of importation of cacao beans and other cacao products was recorded at 12,580 t in 1982 which valued at $27 million. This problem made the country to import that much because the estimated domestic production amounted only 5,400 t. Although, the increment in the total area planted to cacao in 1986 (15,230 ha) substantially contributed to the decrease in the volume of our cacao imports. In that year, the country’s export volume dominated that of the import. The reduction in the import volume was due to efforts of the government and the private sectors to develop and improve the cacao industry and boost the country’s export of cacao.</p>
			<p>In 2014, the area planted to cacao was about 12, 035 ha (Figure 1), with most of this can be found in Davao Region, CARAGA, Northern Mindanao, Cagayan Valley and SOCCSKSARGEN.</p>

			<p>The domestic production of cacao beans has decreased during the past 25 years, from 1990-2014 (Figure 2). Estimated production from 1990 was recorded at 9,800 t and gradually decreased to 4,900 t in 2013. In 2012, the total imports of cacao and cacao products were estimated to 3,662 tons, having a CIF value of roughly US$ 12 million. While the total exports in the same year was 512 tons, having a total FOB value of US$ 1.8 million.</p>
