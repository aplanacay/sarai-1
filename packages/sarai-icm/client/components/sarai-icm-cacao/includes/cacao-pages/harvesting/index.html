			<h1>Cacao - Harvesting</h1>
			<!---->
			<p>Cacao pods are ready for harvest within 5 to 6 months from flowering. In the Philippines, the major peak of harvest starts during September up to December, while the minor peak happens from May to June.</p>
			<p>Maturity period depends on the variety and climatic conditions like rainfall distribution and temperature. Pod ripeness is indicated by color change that commonly starts in the furrow; green-podded varieties turn orange-yellow, while red-podded varieties turn orange.</p>
			<p>Pods are harvested only when they are fully ripe, that is, when at least one-third of the pods has changed color. Ripe pods that are not harvested for more than 3 weeks results in bean germination. Likewise, delayed harvesting can make pest control management complex especially if there is a relatively high incidence of pod diseases and other pests.</p>
			<p>Pods should not be twisted, twitched, nor pulled off during harvesting to avoid damaging the flower cushions which will still produce new flowers in the seasons to come. Instead, sharp instruments like machete, cutlass, knife, bolo, scythe or shears should be used. A knife can be attached to a pole to reach high branches. Pods should be cut as close to the stem as possible and care must be taken to avoid damaging the pods.</p>
