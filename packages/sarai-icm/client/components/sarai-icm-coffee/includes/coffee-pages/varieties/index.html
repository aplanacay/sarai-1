			<p><strong>Coffee Species and Varieties</strong></p>
			<p>Arabica (<em>Coffea arabica</em>)</p>
			<p>Arabica is the most cultivated species of coffee around the world. It is considered to have excellent cup quality and with the least caffeine content (0.8-1.3%) among the four species of coffee. Arabica bears earlier, producing two years after transplanting. In the Philippines, most Arabica plantations are found in the mountains such as Mt. Apo in Davao, Mt. Kitanglad in Bukidnon, and Mt. Matutum in South Cotabato, Kalamansig in Sultan Kudarat and Cordillera Region.</p>
			<p>National Seed Industry Council (NSIC) approved Arabica varieties are: SMCC-0006 HDT, SMCC-0011 Arabica 1, SMCC-0046 Arabica 2, SMCC-0056 Cat Ao, BPI Baguio Red Bourbon, BPI Baguio Arabica Caturra, and BPI Baguio Yellow Bourbon.</p>
			<p>Robusta (<em>Coffea canephora</em>)</p>
			<p>Seventy percent of coffee farmers are growing Robusta coffee. Robusta has the smallest berry size among four species. Unlike Arabica, it has the highest caffeine content (2-2.5%) thus, the robust flavor it gives. Robusta is mainly produced for instant coffee processing.</p>
			<p>NSIC approved Robusta varieties are: SMCC-0043 H33, SMCC-0063 RMS, SMCCC-0020 IC<sub>2</sub>, SMCC-0022 IC<sub>4</sub>, IC<sub>7 </sub>(FRT 01), IC<sub>8 </sub>(FRT 07), CvSU Kapeng Manipis, FRT 10, FRT 12, FRT 14, FRT 14, FRT 23, FRT 48, and FRT 65. Among the registered varieties, ICs and FRTs are widely planted as these are also recommended by large coffee processing companies to farmers growing coffee.</p>
			<p>Excelsa (<em>Coffea excelsa</em>)</p>
			<p>Excelsa is similar to Liberica except for its smoother, thinner and more rounded leaves with smooth edge. Berry size is larger than Arabica but smaller than Liberica. Excelsa has deeper root system making it resistant to drought. Excelsa berries usually mature later compared to Arabica and Robusta. There is no variety registered for Excelsa coffee.</p>
			<p>Liberica (<em>Coffea liberica</em>)</p>
			<p>Liberica is also known as “Kapeng Barako” in the Philippines because it produces the largest berries with thick and firm pulp. This species is tolerant to drought and can grow in wider type of soil. Variety CvSU Barako is the only NSIC registered variety.</p>
