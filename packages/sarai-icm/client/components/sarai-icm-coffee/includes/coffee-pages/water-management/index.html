			<h1>Coffee - Water Management</h1>
			<!---->
			<p>In establishing a farm, planting of coffee seedlings can be done at the onset of rainy season. However, irrigated farms can plant any time as long as the water supplied to the plants is sufficient for optimum growth.</p>
			<p>Coffee requires a short water stress or dry period then followed by rain or irrigation to induce flowering. Using this principle, flowering of coffee can be managed to reduce the irregular flowering of coffee by regulating the watering schedule of the trees. During a continuous rain or irrigation, dormant flower buds are developed. Farmers can continue irrigation until each nodes of the stem have formed enough dormant flowers. Water stress can now be imposed to these coffee trees with dormant flower buds. It can be a long mild water stress or short intense water stress. This stress, if interrupted with irrigation or rainfall,will stimulate anthesis and uniform flowering.. Uniform flowering in coffee is important to farmers as it also means uniform ripening. This can reduce the length of harvesting period and labor cost in harvesting.</p>
