			<h1>Coffee - Processing</h1>
			<!---->
			<p>Primary Processing</p>
			<p>Primary processing is a series of methods to produce the green coffee beans. During the processing, coffee berries in the form of dried berries or parchment coffee are produced as a partially processed coffee. These forms of coffee can be sold to coffee bean processors if the farmers do not have the equipment for further processing to produce green coffee beans. Green coffee bean is the most marketable form of coffee.</p>
			<p>Primary processing of coffee beans can be done by wet method or dry method. Wet method is applicable for ripe berries, which are harvested by priming method. Berries are soaked in water to remove the floaters for 12-24h and to soften the pulp of the berries that remained at the bottom. Berries are depulped using a pulping machine. Depulping removes the exocarp and mesocarp of the berries. Pulped berries are fermented for 24 hours and then dried under the sun, in solar dryer or in an oven. In this stage, parchment coffee is produced. Parchment coffee is dried coffee with the hard endocarp and silver skin or spermoderm still attached to the beans. When beans are dried, dehulling is done to remove the parchment.</p>
			<p>Dry method is drying the harvested beans after removing the floaters. Sun drying or using solar and mechanical dryer can be done to remove the moisture from the berries until dry enough for dehulling. Dried berries are dehulled to remove the dried exocarp, mesocap, and endocarp. Green beans are then kept for secondary processing or for selling to large coffee companies.</p>
			<p>After dehulling of dried coffee berries or parchment coffee, beans are sorted out to remove defects. Green beans are then kept with moisture content not exceeding 13% until the time of selling. Dried green coffee beans are graded upon selling. Beans are evaluated depending on the percentage of different defects and moisture content.</p>

			<p>Grading of Green Coffee Beans</p>
			<p>Upon selling of green beans to the buyers, the quality of green beans is evaluated according to its general state and the occurrence of defects. In general, green beans should have moisture content between 9%-12%. The overall smell and taste of green beans should not be moldy, musty or any foreign odor. The green beans should be from homogenous species.</p>
			<p>Green coffee beans are graded from 1-3 depending on the species and percent defect. Arabica coffee with 7% or less defect is graded 1. Beans with 8-15% is graded 2, and 16-20% defect is graded 3. Robusta coffee is graded 1 when defect is 8% and below, grade 2 if defect is 9-15%, and grade 3 if 16-17%. Liberica and Excelsa coffee have the same grading scheme with grade 1 for 10% defect or less, grade 2 for 11-15% defect and grade 3 for 16-15% defect.</p>

			<p>Defects are determined and defined by the Bureau of Agriculture and Fisheries Product Standards (BAFPS) as the following:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Black bean, more than half of the bean is externally black</li>
			<li>Fermented/Sour bean, where more than one-half of bean surface is dark brown or chestnut in color</li>
			<li>Husk fragment, fragment of husk pericarp with or without silverskin and parchment</li>
			<li>Husk bean, dried coffee cherry</li>
			<li>Broken bean, fragment of coffee bean of which the size is equal to or less than 3/4 of the whole bean</li>
			<li>Immature bean, unripe coffee bean of greenish or greyish color often with a wrinkled surface, caused by premature harvesting</li>
			<li>Infested bean, coffee bean with one or more holes caused by insects</li>
			<li>Foreign body, foreign or extraneous materials, such as sticks, stones, other crops, hard earth, and wood</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Storage</p>
			<p>For longer shelf life, coffee is stored in the form of green coffee beans. In storing green coffee bean, jute sack or other bags made of natural fiber must be used. It is important to keep the beans in an area with humidity less than 60%. At above 80% humidity, the beans will start to absorb moisture. A good storage facility is preferably has cement floor with a damp-proof course, waterproof windows and roof, and a high ceiling to allow good ventilation. It is also important that the storage facility is not subject to flooding.</p>
