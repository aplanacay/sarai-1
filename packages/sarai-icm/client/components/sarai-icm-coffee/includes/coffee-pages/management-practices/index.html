			<h1>Coffee - Management Practices</h1>
			<!---->
			<p><strong>Fertilization</strong></p>
			<p>Fertilizer recommendation should be based on the soil analysis from the farm to avoid over or under fertilization. In absence of soil analysis, recommendations are 120-120-60 (N-P-K) for non-bearing coffee trees and (120-60-120) for bearing trees.</p>
			<p>In Type IV Climate, it is advisable to divide the recommended rate into several applications. In areas with two distinct wet and dry seasons, recommendation can be split into two applications.</p>
			<p><strong>Shading</strong></p>
			<p>In areas where there is a long dry period and where soil moisture retention is low, shade trees should no the planted to preclude competition for moisture and minimize evapotranspiration. Instead, mulching should be employed.</p>
			<p>Where soil fertility is low and where fertilizer is inadequate, the shade trees should be plated to regulate fruiting. Where soils are of high fertility and where fertilizer is adequate, there should be no shading to get maximum yields.</p>
			<p>Shade trees should be a fast-growing legume and of economic value. Degree of shading should be modified relative to local growing conditions. A popular shade tree for coffee is Madre de cacao (<em>Gliricidia sepium</em>).</p>
			<p><strong>Mulching</strong></p>
			<p>Mulching improves soil texture, nutrient content, water absorption and moisture retention. It also minimizes soil erosion and lowers soil temperature. Spreading dried leaves and other organic farm wastes around the base of the plant increases yield and cuts down cost. It improves organic matter content of the soil, conserves soil water moisture, lowers soil temperature and decreases soil erosion.</p>
			<p><strong>Cover cropping</strong></p>
			<p>With coffee usually being grown in the mountain areas, soil pH, soil erosion and soil conservation are major concerns. Such concerns can be remedied by covering the ground with a leguminous crop like <em>Arachis pintoi</em> or Pinto peanut. This plant develops a strong mat of rooted stolons and is suitable for conservation of soil in steep slopes. As a leguminous crop, it also improves the Nitrogen content as well as the other nutrients of the soil (Johns, 1994). It also improves the pH of the typically red acidic soil of the mountainous growing areas. Other cover crops that can be used are Kudzu, Spineless mimosa, and Flemingia.</p>
			<p><strong>Pruning and Canopy Management</strong></p>
			<p>General pruning is the removal of broken, dead, diseased, and pest-infested branches. This removes possible host for pests and diseases. Pruning is practiced to improve yield by reducing biennial bearing and supplying a good growth for the next season’s crop. Most farmers prune their coffee trees after or during harvesting.</p>
			<p>Training of multiple stems is a common practice in coffee farming because it increases the yield of berries per tree. Three vigorous laterals are chosen to become the main stems of the plant. Stems should be equidistant from each stem. Training sticks can be used to spread the stems to allow light to penetrate the middle portion of the tree. Extra sprouts should be removed.</p>
			<p><strong>Rejuvenation</strong></p>
			<p>Rejuvenation in coffee is generally defined as the cutting of vertical stems of old trees to induce growth of new sprouts. It is a widely accepted practice for revitalizing coffee farms and has been found to be more advantageous than replanting. In the Philippines, there is a need to convince more coffee growers that rejuvenation can significantly increase the production of their trees.</p>
			<p>In rejuvenation, an upward slanting cut is made up to about 75 percent of the stem’s diameter and about two feet from the base. The stem is bent towards the ground slowly to avoid splitting or cracking of the main stem. When sprouts are about 10 cm high, cut and separate the upper portion of the tree from the main stem. The cut should be slanting and about 30 cm from the ground. Five to seven sprouts that are uniformly distanced are selected and maintained. Other sprouts are removed. When the sprouts are 30 cm high, sprouts uniformly distance around the stem are selected. All other sprouts must be removed as the come out. As the vertical sprouts grow, the stems are trained towards outside the crown. This will encourage maximum sunlight penetration and better growth and fruiting.</p>
