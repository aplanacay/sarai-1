			<h1>Coffee - Pest Management</h1>
			<!---->
			<p>Berry borer (<em>Hypothenemus hampei </em>Ferrari)</p>
			<p>The female digs holes in young berries to lay eggs, which develop into larvae that destroy the beans. To control berry borers, berries that ripen outside the normal harvest season are collected and destroyed. All berries on the ground and/or black berries on the trees at the end of the peak harvest season, must be picked.</p>
			<p>Twig borer (<em>Xyleborus morstatti</em> Haq.)</p>
			<p>A small Coleopteran, the females dig small holes on the undersurface of twigs and tunnel into the young branches to lay eggs. Infested twigs then dry up. Affected branches must be collected and burned.</p>
			<p>White grub (<em>Holotrichia</em> spp.)</p>
			<p>The larva eats the feeding roots of coffee. Young plants die while old ones are stunted. Affected hills should be dug out to collect and kill the grubs. At planting, pesticides are applied to each hill. During summer, when adults lay eggs in the soil, pesticides are applied in the vicinity of the root zone.</p>
			<p>Mealy bugs (<em>Ferrisia virgata</em> Ckll. and <em>Planococcus lilacinus</em> Ckll.) and scale insect (<em>Coccus viridis</em> Green)</p>
			<p>These Homopterans live on the tender parts of plant and suck the sap. Insecticides, usually mixed with detergent, are used to control mealy bugs and scale insects. Cochin oil is also an alternative.</p>
			<p>Caterpillars</p>
			<p>Larvae feed on the leaves of coffee. Caterpillars should be collected and killed as necessary to reduce damage. Insecticides may be applied on affected portions.</p>
			<p>Coffee Rust (<em>Hemileia vastatrix</em>)</p>
			<p>Orange rust-like spots appear on the lower surface of infected leaves. Spots soon increase and cause loss of leaves. The growing area should be regularly cleaned and excess coffee branches should be pruned to minimize humidity that favors the development of spores. Copper fungicides may be sprayed on the leaf undersurface, as much as twice a year.</p>
			<p>Black Rot (<em>Kolerga noxis</em>)</p>
			<p>The pathogen causes blackening of infected leaves and twigs. Timely cleaning and pruning of thick branches deters the spread of the disease.</p>
			<p>Anthracnose (<em>Colletotrichum coffeanum</em>)</p>
			<p>Infested leaves show brown blights while infested twigs exhibit a dieback effect. Infested berries develop a brownish depression on the pulp. Branches affected by anthracnose must be pruned and burned.</p>
