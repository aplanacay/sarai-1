			<h1>Coffee - Harvesting</h1>
			<!---->
			<p>After transplanting of coffee seedlings, first flowering can happen from 12-36 months in Arabica and 9-14 months in Robusta. Excelsa and Liberica can flower in as early as 3 months after transplanting. From flowering, fruits ripen from 8-10 months.</p>
			<p>Harvesting is done when the berries changed color from green to red, dark red or yellow, depending on the variety. Berries can be hard ripe to soft ripe which are both good for harvesting.</p>
			<p>Priming is the manual selection and picking of only red ripe coffee berries. This practice is recommended to produce better quality coffee. Harvesting period can last up to 3 months, which means more labor cost, because of the prolonged harvesting period of coffee due to irregular flowering and ripening of berries.</p>
			<p>Another method is stripping. It is the harvesting of all coffee berries in a lateral when 50% of the berries in are ripe. This means green unripe berries will be included in processing. Green berries cannot be pulped properly and also give poor-quality coffee. Typically, berries are harvested in a stripping method undergoes dry method of processing.</p>
