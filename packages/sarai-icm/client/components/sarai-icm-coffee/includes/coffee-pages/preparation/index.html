			<h1>Coffee - Preparation</h1>
			<!---->
			<p><strong>Agro-Climatic Requirements</strong></p>
			<p>Land and Soil Requirement</p>
			<p>Coffee plant requires loamy soil up to 150 cm depth for better root anchorage and improved water and nutrient absorption. It can tolerate acidic soils to low as pH=4.5. The ideal area for a coffee farm should be flat to gently sloping and with good soil drainage. If the slope of the area is above 18%, the Sloping Agricultural Land Technology (SALT) must be employed to minimize soil erosion while growing coffee.</p>
			<p>Elevation</p>
			<p>Arabica generally requires high altitudes but its growth and production are optimum at 900 to 1,800 meters above sea level (masl). Robusta, Excelsa, and Liberica, on the other hand, can be grown from sea level up to 900 masl.</p>
			<p>Climatic Requirement</p>
			<p>Climatic requirement of coffee varies with species. In general, Robusta, Excelsa, and Liberica grow best within 15-30°C with 1000-2000 mm of annual precipitation. On the other hand, Arabica grows best within 15-25°C and 1500-2000 mm. However, the amount of moisture required by coffee plants is influenced by the evaporation rate, which in turn is influenced by humidity and temperature.</p>
			<p>Suitability</p>
			<p>Areas within the Philippines that qualify the specific agro-climatic requirements of coffee are identified and plotted in maps for better reference of end-users like the farmers and technicians. The suitability map is determined by several environmental factors including elevation, annual precipitation, dry period, soil pH, and soil texture.</p>
			<p>Isabela, Nueva Ecija, Bulacan, Southern Tagalog, , Bicol, Western Visayas, Davao, Agusan del Sur and Zamboanga del Norte have large areas that are suitable for growing Robusta coffee. Arabica, on the other hand, is suitable in the highlands of Cordillera, ARMM and Davao regions.</p>
			<p><strong>Propagation of Coffee</strong></p>
			<p>Sexual propagation</p>
			<p>Sexual propagation is recommended only for Arabica coffee which is autogamous, meaning it can be be self-pollinated.</p>
			<p>Seeds should be gathered from high-yielding trees, which are free from pests and diseases. Large and fully ripe berries are selected as planting materials.</p>
			<p>Seeds are placed in a bucket of water to remove the floaters. Berries are then depulped manually by hand or mechanically using a pulping machine. Seeds are soaked in water for 24 hours to ferment. Germination is induced by placing the seeds in a sufficiently moist environment to absorb water. Depending on temperature and moisture, the cotyledon leaves develop after four to six weeks. This is the butterfly or jaguar ear stage.&nbsp; When the seedlings are ready for transplanting, with 6-8 pairs of leaves, gradually remove the shade to accustom plants to direct sunlight until two weeks before transplanting.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Vegetative propagation</p>
			<p>Vegetative propagation is the method of propagation recommended for Robusta, Excelsa and Liberica, which are allogamous or self-infertile species. This method produces true-to-type and uniform planting materials.</p>
			<p>Coffee clone is used as mother plant or as source of stem cuttings. A vertical shoot, finger size and about one foot long with four nodes, is split lengthwise into two halves. Leaves should be partially cut before splitting. Nodal cuttings are set in a germination box, 1 x 2 inches apart and 1 inch deep. The box must be placed in a chamber. Nodal cuttings will produce roots and shoots within 45 days. Rooting hormones can be used to enhance the root formation, thus the survival of the cuttings.</p>
			<p>Rooted cuttings are then pricked into individual plastic bags with soil. After the seedlings have developed 4-6 pairs of leaves, about 6-8 months, planting in the farm can be done. This type of planting material bear earlier than plants produced from seeds.</p>
			<p><strong>Planting Systems</strong></p>
			<p>Monocropping</p>
			<p>Monocropping is planting of pure coffee trees in an area. This type of cropping does not provide shading to the coffee trees. The recommended planting distance for Arabica and Robusta is 3m x 2m while 4m x 4m for Liberica and Excelsa.</p>
			<p>Intercropping with Coconut</p>
			<p>Coffee is a popular intercrop under mature coconut stands. The shade from coconut palms provides optimum conditions for growth and productivity of coffee. The crop is best planted at 2 meters away from the base of coconut palms in 3 rows at 3 x 3 meters triangular under coconut distanced 10 x 10 meters square or 2 rows at 3 x 3 meters in a triangular pattern under coconut distanced 8 x 8 or 9 x 9 meters square.</p>
			<p>Intercropping with other crops</p>
			<p>Intercropping is done for farmers to generate income while they wait for the harvest of coffee beans. In this case, coffee trees are planted with 5m x 2m planting distance and can be intercropped with cassava, corn and other vegetables. Leguminous crops are also ideal as intercrops to improve nitrogen fixation in the soil.</p>
