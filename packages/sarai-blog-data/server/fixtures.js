        content: '<p>A Training Workshop on Crop Modeling and Simulation was held last 12-13 March 2015 at the Continuing Education Center (CEC), UPLB. This was attended by 57 representatives from the different partner SUCs including Western Visayas State University (WVSU), Misamis Oriental State College of Agriculture and Technology (MOSCAT), Cebu Technological University (CTU), Isabela State University (ISU), Bicol University College of Agriculture & Forestry (BUCAF), Local Government Unit (LGU) of Wao, University of Southeastern Philippines (USeP), University of Southern Mindanao (USM), Central Mindanao University (CMU), Southern Philippines Agri-Business and Marine and Aquatic School of Technology (SPAMAST) and Central Luzon State University (CLSU). Representatives from PCAARRD also joined the training.</p><p>Resource persons were invited to give lectures on crop production systems, specifically on the key concept on crop simulation and modeling. The participants were also taught how to use the Decision Support System for Agro-technology Transfer (DSSAT). This crop modeling software can be used to model climate variability, water management, yield gap analysis, and site-specific management. Participants were also introduced to a software for systems modeling in crop protection called STELLA.</p>',

        content: '<p>Paving way for smarter agriculture sector – Project SARAI (Smarter Approaches to Reinvigorate Agriculture as an Industry in the Philippines) participated in the DOST-PCAARRD SIPAG Fiesta Exhibit, held at DOST-PCAARRD Technology and Innovation Center (DPTIC), March 2-4, 2016.</p><p>DOST Sec. Mario Montejo, USec. Amy Guevara, and Sen. Cynthia Villar were present, and visited the live demos of Project SARAI. The visit allowed for numerous comments and suggestions as to how to improve and refine the existing systems and tehcnologies.</p><p>Project SARAI showcased five systems and technologies which all contribute to making a more proactive and resilient agriculture sector.</p><p><strong>SARAI Systems and Technologies</strong></p><p>1. Cost-efficient soil moisture sensors and meters</p><p>The project fabricated soil moisture meters, and installed them in selected experimental sites for monitoring soil moisture content. Through real-time and proactive monitoring, farmers can easily decide when to increase the water level in their farms.</p><p>2. Smarter Pest Identification Technology (SPId Tech)</p><p>SPId Tech works like Facebook face recognition every time you upload pictures and want to tag your friends; only that with SPId Tech, we’ll be detecting pests. It can identify rice and corn pests through your uploaded images. Farmers and technicians can easily upload pest incidences in their farms, and wait for the application to identify the pest, and give immediate pest management protocols.</p><p>3. SARAI-Enhanced Agricultural Monitoring System (SEAMS)</p><p>SEAMS uses free and daily updated satellite images from US and Europe. These satellite images are used for near real-time monitoring of the actual area planted to rice and corn. Other uses of SEAMS include land use change, vulnerability assessment, identification of possible breeding grounds of major insect pests, and weather condition in areas without weather stations.</p><p>One output of SEAMS is the crop damage assessment in Nueva Ecija rice farms right after typhoon Lando. The assessment provided the Department of Agriculture Operations (DA Operations) clearer figures of the damages areas, and the areas that can still be replanted with rice.</p><p>4. Automatic Weather Station (AWS) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)</p><p>Project SARAI has installed AWS units in various SUCs nationwide to have a near real-time access to the different weather parameters in cropping areas. The UAV, installed with a multispectral camera, is used to fly over vegetation areas; and the team is refining how to better analyze the images. Possible analysis could include crop health, and spread of pest infestation.</p><p>5. SARAI Knowledge Portal</p><p>This online knowledge portal houses all the outputs and systems of the program. One special feature of the SARAI knowledge portal ae the interactive maps where the visitors can easily see various information such as: crop suitability maps and vulnerability maps.</p><p>Project SARAI is a three-year research program funded by DOST-PCAARRD which aims to develop a crop forecasting and crop monitoring system for six priority crops – rice, corn, coconut, banana, coffee and cacao. The crop forecasting and monitoring system will allow for formulation of crop advisories, such as planting dates, site-specific nutrient and water management, and possible pest infestation, among many others. The project aims to reach out to the farmers through SMS, onsite trainings, and an accessible online portal.</p>',

Prof. Vicente Ballaran, and Dr. Ronaldo Saludes, in cooperation with DA Operations, held the first regional SARAI-Enhanced Agricultural Monitoring System (SEAMS) training and validation with the DA Region IV-B Agricultural Officers, February 1 to 5, 2016.</p><p>A total of 6 municipalities attended the SEAMS training. Region IV-B was selected by DA-Operations as the pilot site for the training and validation of SEAMS.</p><p>SEAMS can help agricultural officers monitor the crop health and status of the farmers. More so, SEAMS can help provide near real-time, site-specific advisories.</p><p>Another use of SEAMS that could greatly benefit the regional offices is the capability to assess crop damage due to typhoons, El Niño, and other climate extremes.</p>',
