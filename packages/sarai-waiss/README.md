# Water Balance - Assisted Irrigation Decision Support System (WAISS)

WAISS is an irrigation decision support system that aims to help its users determine when and how much they need to irrigate their farm. Using weather data, WAISS calculates the water deficit in your farm's soil. Based on your farm's data, you should expect to see an advisory of whether or not you should immediately irrigate your farm.
